# Number Guess Game – Original Source Version 🎯

This branch contains the **original, unmodified version** of the Number Guess Game project exactly as it was provided at the start of the DevOps group assignment.  
It includes the raw Java Servlet, JSP, and configuration files before any UI enhancements, styling updates, or CI/CD automation work.
